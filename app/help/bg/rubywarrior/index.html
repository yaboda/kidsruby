    <p>Ruby Warrior is a game designed to teach Ruby in a fun, interactive way. It was created by Ryan Bates.</p>
    <p>You play as a warrior climbing a tall tower to reach the precious Ruby at the top level. On each floor you need to write a Ruby script to instruct the warrior to battle enemies, rescue captives, and reach the stairs. You have some idea of what each floor contains, but you never know for certain what will happen. You must give the Warrior up-front to find their own way.</p>
    <p>You will need to program your Player, to tell him or her how to figure out what to do. You can start by entering this little bit of Ruby code into the editor to the left:</p>
    <pre id="code-1-1" class="sampleCode">Code automatically inserted here...</pre>

    <p>
    To start the game, you also need to enter this other little bit of Ruby code into the editor to the left:</p>
    <pre id="code-1-2" class="sampleCode">Code automatically inserted here...</pre>

    <p>You will need to make sure the Ruby code for the <code>Player</code> comes before the <code>RubyWarrior.play</code> command.</p>
    <p>To start playing the game just click on the "Run" button, and follow the instructions that will start to appear in the "Output" tab. Have fun!</p>
