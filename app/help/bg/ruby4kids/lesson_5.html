    <section class="page"><h1>This is Ruby4Kids</h1>

      <p>Now, we're going to learn how to move right, up, and down. To move right, we need to add another <code>if</code> statement to the <code>def update</code> under the class <code>MyGame</code>. So, let's add an <code>if</code> statement for the right key:</p>
      <pre id="code-5-1" class="sampleCode">Code automatically inserted here...</pre>

      <p>The part above is the same as the code for turning left, except that now we type <code>KbRight</code> instead of <code>KbLeft</code>.</p>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>Lesson 5 - Moving Right, Up, and Down</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>Plus 10</h1>

      <p> Now, we're going to be going to the <code>Player</code> class and adding: </p>
   
      <pre id="code-5-2" class="sampleCode">Code automatically inserted here...</pre>

      <p> So, this time the code is a bit less similar to what we did in the last lesson. You'll notice that we added <code>+ 10</code> instead of <code>- 10</code>, because we're going right instead of left. </p>

      <p> Another difference is that we limit the icon by the game window's width and then subtract a certain amount of pixels from that width. Now, we subtract those pixels, because the position x is actually on the left side of the icon. That means that we have to make up for that amount by subtracting from the pixel count. You can try putting in different numbers within: </p>
      <pre id="code-5-3" class="sampleCode">Code automatically inserted here...</pre>
      <p> to see what I mean, as long as both the numbers match up. </p>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>Lesson 5 - Moving Right, Up, and Down</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>Moving Up</h1>

      <p> OK, now that we've accomplished going left and right, we're going to try out how to go up. So, we'll first type the following code under the <code>def update</code> in the <code>MyGame</code> class
      <pre id="code-5-4" class="sampleCode">Code automatically inserted here...</pre>

      <p>So, that part was familiar. Now, we're going to go to the <code>Player</code> class and add: </p>
      <pre id="code-5-5" class="sampleCode">Code automatically inserted here...</pre>

      <p> Now, you'll notice that both the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> statements are both different than what we did before. The first difference is that we're now using a y coordinate. The y coordinate is used, because we are going up and down (in this case, up), rather than left and right, just like on a grid!</p>

      <p> So, you might also be wondering, why is the formula <code>y < 0</code>? Isn't <code>y < 0</code> supposed to be for going down? That would have been the case, had the pixel count increased as you went up. Instead, it's the other way around. </p>

      <p> Basically, it means that the very top of the screen is at 0.00 and increases as you go down the y-axis. So, as the icon moves up, it's actually decreasing the pixel count. This decrease in count is also the reason why we have a <code>- 10</code> instead of a <code>+ 10</code>.</p>.

  <article class="lesson"><h1>Lesson 5 - Moving Right, Up, and Down</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>Moving Down</h1>
      <p> Now, let's finish up by adding the <code>move_down</code> code. These steps  should look really familiar to the steps where we learned how to move right. First, let's write the following under the class <code>MyGame</code>, right below <code>def update</code>:

      <pre id="code-5-6" class="sampleCode">Code automatically inserted here...</pre>

      <p>Finally, we'll type the following under the <code>player</code> class </p>

      <pre id="code-5-7" class="sampleCode">Code automatically inserted here...</pre>

      <p> So, the only difference that you'll see here is that the <code>- 10</code> is changed to <code>+ 10</code>, because the numbers increase as you go down :). That's it for moving around!</p> 
      
      <p>Here is the entire program you should have written so far:</p>
      <pre id="code-5-8" class="sampleCode">Code automatically inserted here...</pre>

      <p>You've accomplished so much already, so why stop?! How about we turn up the heat and add some <a href="lesson_6.html">dodgeballs in lesson 6</a>!</p>
